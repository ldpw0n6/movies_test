## Getting Started

- First you need to download the code from the repository to your computer.
- Then go to the project folder, open the android folder and in the key.properties file change the current path to your project path
- Open a terminal console at the root of the project and run the flutter build apk command
- When the command finishes it will find the app in the path build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-release.apk inside the project
- Copy the app to your android device and install it
- and that's it. I hope it will be useful for you
